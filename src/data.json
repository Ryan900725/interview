    "summary": "What is Blockchain?",
    "details": "A blockchain is an ever-growing ledger in a network, which keeps a track record of all transactions, changes and implementations that have taken place inside the network in a secure, ordered and immutable way. In simple terms, it is a chain of blocks like a linked list, with each node being before and after another node. All nodes or blocks have links to the next node, just like pointers in programming.\nEach block records all of the recent transactions, and once completed goes into the blockchain as a permanent database. This technique is based on Cryptographic Concepts of Information Security, which will be studied later on. Each time a block gets completed, a new block is generated. Once a block of information is created in the chain, it can’t be changed or deleted. This makes the blockchain very secure and trustworthy.\n\nA blockchain network is independent of centralized institutions, and it can work without any need for third-party middle-man such as central authorities, banks, government, etc. Transactions are verified by a network of computers. A blockchain network is based on the internet, and hence, it cannot run offline."

Through this common ledger, transactions are documented just one time, removing the need for redundant work that is common in conventional business networks.\n\n-Immutable Records\nIt is impossible for any participant to alter or manipulate a transaction once it has been documented on the shared ledger. In the event of an error in a transaction record, a new transaction must be created to correct the mistake, and both transactions will be transparently displayed.\n\n-Smart Contracts\nTo speed transactions, a set of rules that are called a smart contract is stored on the blockchain and run automatically. A smart contract defines conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more."

    "summary": "How blockchain works?",
    "details": "A blockchain consists of small sequenced programs, known as scripts, which conduct the tasks available in a database, like entering information, accessing data stored in the database, saving data and copying it elsewhere. By default, data once saved in a ledger cannot be altered. A blockchain is distributed, which means multiple copies are saved on many machines, and they must all match for it to be valid.\n\nTransactions in a network follow a sequence of steps, which may differ depending on the type of network where they are implemented. Generally, when a transaction is initiated, the application that provides an interface for the blockchain starts a sequence of events.\n\nEvery node in the network proposes its own blocks in this way because they all choose different transactions. Each works on their own blocks, trying to find a solution to the difficulty target, using the query number used once, also called by its acronym nonce. Once a block is closed, a transaction is complete."

    "summary": "Features of Blockchain",
    "details": "Blockchain technology is a major booming force for decentralized cryptocurrencies across the globe. Due to its many features, it finds use in various sectors of modern life.\n\n-Decentralization\nA blockchain facilitates the distribution of data across multiple network nodes—computers or devices operating blockchain software, located in different geographical areas. This architecture not only ensures redundancy, but also preserves the integrity of the data.\nFor instance, if an attempt is made to modify a record at one instance of the database, the other nodes will thwart this action by comparing block hashes. Consequently, no individual node within the network possesses the capability to alter information contained within the chain.\n\n-Transparency\nDue to the decentralized structure of all blockchain networks, all transactions are openly accessible for viewing by downloading and examining them, or by utilizing blockchain explorers that enable real-time monitoring of transactions.\nEvery node maintains its own version of the chain, which is continuously updated with the addition of new blocks. Consequently, it is possible to trace the movement of a bitcoin to its destination, if desired.\n\n-Security\nBlockchain technology ensures decentralized security and trust through various methods. Initially, new blocks are consistently stored in a linear and chronological manner, always being appended to the last of the blockchain. Once a block is added to the end of the blockchain, it becomes immutable, preventing any changes to previous blocks.\nA modification in any data within a block alters its hash value. Since each block includes the hash of the previous block, any change would impact subsequent blocks. In the event of an attempt to modify a block, the network would reject it due to hash inconsistencies. Nevertheless, this manipulation can potentially occur in smaller blockchain networks.\n\n\n\n"

    "summary": "Key Factors of a Blockchain Networks",
    "details": "-Distributed structure − The distributed nature of a blockchain network is a key characteristic. It eliminates the necessity for a central authority and enables multiple nodes to engage in the network and verify transactions.\n-Blocks − A block is a data unit that comprises a group of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block, also referred to as a hash. This forms a chain of blocks, hence the term blockchain.\n-Nodes − Nodes are the computers or devices that take part in the blockchain network. Each node retains a copy of the entire blockchain and aids in validating transactions and generating new blocks.\n-Consensus mechanism − To ensure data integrity, the network employs a consensus mechanism. This enables nodes to agree on transaction validity and helps prevent unauthorized modifications to the blockchain by malicious actors.\n-Public/private keys − Public and private keys are utilized to create a digital signature for each transaction. The public key encrypts the data, while the private key decrypts it.\n-Hashes − A hash is a crucial element of blockchain technology, serving as the foundation of its secure architecture. Essentially, a hash is a unique representation of data generated through a cryptographic hash function. It functions as a digital fingerprint for each block in the blockchain, offering a secure and immutable means to identify and trace the block.\n-Chain of blocks − The hash of a block is connected to the hash of the preceding block, forming a chain of blocks that establishes the core of a blockchain’s architecture.\n-Proof-of-work − This mechanism makes it challenging for anyone to alter the information stored in a blockchain. It entails a computational work process that must be executed to append a new block to the chain, rendering it time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n-Block formation of transactions − Within a blockchain network, transactions are compiled into blocks. Each block is characterized by a timestamp, a reference to the preceding block (commonly referred to as a hash), and a collection of transactions. This structure results in a sequential chain of blocks, which is the essence of blockchain technology.\n-Node verification − The nodes within a blockchain network play a pivotal role in validating transactions and incorporating new blocks into the blockchain. For instance, when a user intends to transfer funds to another individual, the transaction must undergo verification by the network's nodes prior to its inclusion in the blockchain.\n-Role of cryptography − Cryptography serves as a fundamental component of blockchain architecture, ensuring the security of the data contained within the blockchain. Each block and transaction is subject to encryption, and a digital signature is employed to confirm its authenticity. Public and private keys facilitate the creation of a digital signature for each transaction, with the public key utilized for data encryption and the private key for decryption.\n-Crypto tokens − These digital assets are tradable on a blockchain and are frequently employed to motivate nodes to validate new blocks.\n-Smart contracts − A significant feature of blockchain architecture is the implementation of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts automatically enforce the terms of an agreement when specific conditions are satisfied. This functionality removes the necessity for intermediaries, thereby enhancing the efficiency and transparency of the blockchain network. For example, a smart contract can facilitate the automatic transfer of funds from one user to another upon the fulfillment of a predetermined condition, such as the successful completion of a project."

    "details": "A private blockchain is a specific type of blockchain technology that is limited to a particular group of participants and is commonly utilized by organizations and institutions for internal operations. It operates as a permissioned blockchain, meaning it is controlled by a single entity. Unlike public blockchains, private blockchains are not open-source, and only authorized individuals can access the network. This allows for effective blockchain usage while restricting access to selected participants.\n\nOrganizations can establish various parameters for the network, such as accessibility, authorization, and more. Transactions on private blockchains are typically faster and more secure, although they lack the transparency and decentralization of public blockchains. Private blockchains are more scalable when compared to other factors. Permissioned blockchains do not adhere to a decentralized theoretical nature.\n\nSome blockchain platforms are built on private blockchains, and while many consider private blockchains as permissioned blockchains, the concept of permissioned blockchains can encompass public blockchains as well. Due to the limited number of nodes in private blockchains, security may be compromised if a certain number of nodes become malicious and disrupt the consensus mechanism of the network."

    "summary": "Consortium Blockchains",
    "details": "Consortium blockchains represent a blend of public and private blockchain characteristics, aimed at harnessing the advantages of both systems.\n\nAlso referred to as federated blockchains, consortium blockchains offer an innovative solution for organizations that require features from both public and private blockchains. In this model, certain elements of the organizations are accessible to the public, while others are kept confidential. The governance of consortium blockchains is shared among a collective of organizations, rather than being dominated by a single entity or a small group of individuals. These blockchains are particularly prevalent in sectors such as finance, where participating organizations seek a secure and transparent network while retaining a degree of control over its operations.\n\nTo ensure effective functioning, a consortium blockchain typically incorporates a validator node tasked with two primary responsibilities: validating transactions and either initiating or receiving them. In contrast, member nodes within the network are restricted to either initiating or receiving transactions. This structure allows consortium blockchains to provide the advantages of a private blockchain, such as transparency, privacy, and efficiency, without allowing any single participant to wield excessive power or control over the network. By distributing authority and accountability among multiple entities, consortium blockchains achieve an optimal balance of security, flexibility, and accessibility, making them suitable for a variety of applications and use cases."

Nevertheless, there are potential similarities between the two. A hybrid blockchain is characterized as a fusion of a private and public blockchain. This particular blockchain type enables organizations to capitalize on the advantages of both private and public blockchains, providing an optimal solution for their specific requirements.\n\nOperating within a closed ecosystem, a hybrid blockchain grants organizations the necessary control and privacy, while still enabling interaction with a public network. An illustration of a hybrid blockchain includes Dragonchain and XinFin, which present a distinctive solution for organizations seeking a blend of benefits. Through the integration of the privacy and control of a private blockchain with the transparency and accessibility of a public blockchain, organizations can enhance their operations in terms of efficiency and security."

    "summary": "What is Byzantine General's Problem?",
    "details": "The consensus mechanism plays a vital role in any blockchain architecture, as it guarantees the preservation of trust, agreement, and security within a decentralized network of computers. One of the primary challenges that consensus mechanisms address is the Byzantine generals problem, which pertains to achieving consensus in a distributed system. Various consensus mechanisms are available, each presenting its own set of benefits and drawbacks. Commonly utilized mechanisms include proof of work (PoW), proof of stake (PoS), delegated proof of stake (DPoS), and practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT). The choice of a consensus mechanism is influenced by the specific needs of the blockchain network and the necessary trade-offs among security, scalability, and energy efficiency.\n\nThe Byzantine generals problem, derived from a historical scenario involving the Byzantine army, is a computer science dilemma concerning the attainment of consensus in a decentralized environment where some participants may exhibit faults or malicious behavior. In such scenarios, ensuring that all nodes agree on a specific matter, such as the value of a transaction within a blockchain, becomes complex, especially when certain nodes may provide misleading or contradictory information. The lack of secure communication channels introduces the risk of a single point of failure, known as a Byzantine fault, where components may malfunction, and there is uncertainty regarding whether a component has indeed failed.\n\nA blockchain seeks to address this issue by establishing a layer of trust that does not require trust in every individual. Miners and validators play a crucial role in this system. Their objective is to add new entries to the ledger by following the rules of the game. One common consensus mechanism used to tackle the Byzantine generals problem is PoW. In PoW, network nodes compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle, with the first successful node adding the next block to the chain. Subsequently, other nodes validate this block, and upon reaching a consensus on its validity, add it to their ledger. This process ensures a decentralized and secure method of achieving consensus on the system's status.\n\nAnother prevalent consensus mechanism is PoS. In PoS, nodes are selected to validate transactions based on the cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to stake as collateral. This setup incentivizes nodes to act honestly, as any malicious behavior could result in the loss of their staked funds.\n\nPBFT functions as a consensus mechanism utilizing a consensus protocol to determine the next block to be appended to the blockchain. Through communication between nodes, agreement is reached, and a node is only permitted to add a block to the blockchain upon receiving sufficient votes from other nodes within the network."

They ensure the integrity of digital data by preventing alterations. It is important to note that even a minor modification in the input can lead to a completely different hash output, a phenomenon referred to as the avalanche effect. A widely used hash function is SHA-256.\n\n-Symmetric Ciphers − When a message is encrypted with a key, it is transformed into ciphertext, which appears readable yet lacks meaning. The same key is employed to revert the ciphertext to its original message. A key serves as a variable for both encryption and decryption, acting as a mechanism to secure or release data. Notable examples of key-based encryption algorithms include AES, DES, and Blowfish. While symmetric encryption typically offers quicker processing speeds than public-key cryptography, the challenge lies in the secure sharing of keys.\n\n-Asymmetric Ciphers − These utilize a pair of keys, one for encrypting information (the public key) and another for decrypting it (the private key). Examples include RSA, DSA, and elliptic curve cryptography.\nBlock Ciphers − These encrypt data in fixed-size blocks, such as 64 or 128 bits. They are frequently combined with hash functions to ensure the security of lengthy messages.\n\n-Stream Ciphers − These encrypt data one bit or byte at a time, making them particularly effective for protecting real-time information such as audio or video streams.\n\n-Digital Signatures − These provide a method to verify the authenticity of a digital message or information, confirming that it originates from the claimed sender. They employ asymmetric ciphers to create a signature that can be validated using the sender’s public key.\nMessage Authentication Codes − These are similar to digital signatures but use symmetric ciphers to make a code that can be checked using the same secret key used to make it."

Without consensus, conflicting transactions would not be prevented, making it essential for the functioning of cryptocurrency blockchains. Various types of consensus mechanisms exist, each with different energy usage, security, and scalability, but all share the common goal of ensuring the integrity of records.\n\nHere is an outline of some of the most well-known consensus mechanisms utilized by distributed systems to achieve consensus −\n\n-PoW is the original consensus mechanism and was utilized by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, and the first to solve the puzzle is permitted to create a new block and validate transactions. The successful miner is also rewarded with cryptocurrency known as a block reward. PoW is considered a secure and reliable mechanism but requires substantial computational resources and energy, resulting in high operating costs and environmental impact.\n-PoS is a more environmentally-friendly alternative to PoW. In PoS, miners pledge a stake of cryptocurrency and are randomly selected to validate transactions. The more cryptocurrency a miner holds, the higher their chances of being selected. The system favors entities with a higher number of tokens, leading to centralization concerns.\nDPoS is a variation of PoS where the network users vote to select witnesses to secure the network on their behalf. Only the top tier of witnesses with the most votes can validate blockchain transactions. The witnesses are incentivized to remain honest by being at risk of being replaced by those deemed more trustworthy.\n-Proof of activity (PoA) is a hybrid of PoW and PoS, used by the Decred and Espers blockchain projects. The mining process starts like PoW, with miners competing to solve a mathematical problem, then switches to PoS where validators are selected to sign off on the block header. The block rewards are shared between the miner and validators. PoA has been criticized for its energy-intensive mining phase and its partiality towards validators holding a greater number of coins.\n-Proof of Authority (PoA) differs from PoS as it selects validators based on their reputation rather than staking cryptocurrency. This approach requires minimal computing power and is more resource-efficient, but it has faced criticism for its potential to concentrate power among a small number of authoritative nodes."

Traditionally, you would approach a bank, which, in exchange for a fee, would facilitate the transfer to the recipient's bank in the other country. The bank acts as an intermediary by maintaining a centralized database that records and confirms the transaction. However, with the utilization of blockchain technology, it becomes feasible to directly transfer the money to your friend without the involvement of a bank. All that is required is your friend's blockchain address.\n\nBy bypassing the intermediary, disintermediation is achieved, leading to decentralization. This disintermediation model is not limited to the financial sector but can also be applied across various industries such as healthcare, legal, and public services.\n\n-Contest-Driven Decentralization\nIt involves a competitive approach where multiple service providers vie for the opportunity to offer services within a system. While this method does not achieve complete decentralization, it does prevent any single intermediary or service provider from monopolizing the service. In the context of blockchain technology, a system can be envisioned where smart contracts autonomously select an external data provider from a pool of providers based on factors such as reputation, past performance, reviews, and service quality.\n\nAlthough this approach may not lead to absolute decentralization, it empowers smart contracts to make independent choices based on the specified criteria."
